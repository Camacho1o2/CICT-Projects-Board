CatSu CICT Projects Board

I. INTRODUCTION

Have you ever wondered what happens to those digital projects like programs, websites, and mobile apps after that CICT students study and develop them? This website attempts to address this issue by providing a platform specific for CICT students to post their projects to the public. As to how this concept was thought of, an idea popped up of a platform specific for students to post their creations and a question was thought about existence of the projects made by computer illiterate students. With the opportunity to make it happen, this proposal was made.

II. PROJECT GOALS

A problem that not many people take notice is concerning the programs and websites developed by students. What happens after they’re submitted? Do people use them? Those students work for weeks on their projects to get graded but there is more to it than grades. Students actually get to develop digital applications that have differing functions and purposes. And so, such applications must not be wasted or at least should be made known.

Realizing this issue and opportunity, I propose the concept of a website where CICT students can share and post their creations to the public or some selected few as to not waste their idea and/or work.

As for why I chose this concept in dealing with the problem, personally, because of my curiosity of the creations of other students especially of the seniors’. I wondered of what they created when they studied and were tasked in developing programs, websites or other digital projects and how they did them. I was questioning what happened to those projects and if they can be viewed and utilized.
