            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                A website dedicated for the students of CICT which grants the features of letting them showcase their creations to the
                public. Following the theme of a bulletin board, content is shown in papers, sticky notes, banners, etc. It has the colour scheme of
                yellow and blue which are seen in the logo of CICT in CatSU. 
            </p>

            <h3>How to Use</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Upon entering the website, users are prompt to log-in with their account
                    or create one for their own.</li>
                <li>After successfully doing so, they are immediately taken to the main homepage of the website where the
                    posted projects are shown. On the top of the website are banners which the users can interact. Clicking the banners with letters can
                    bring them to the homepage from any other webpage within the website while clicking the orange banner with an account icon
                    will bring them to their profile page.</li>
                <li>If the user is a CICT student, they can post and share their project by clicking the empty slot in the homepage. After which,
                    their post will be seen in the homepage. They can set whether or not the files of their project is accessible in public or not.
                    If the files are private, viewers will have to request the password from the student to access them.</li>
